# The Slash Code Text Editor

* Hey, there! Have you ever wanted to check out smaller programs that aren't Visual Studio Code or Vim with several years of hard work, just something simple you can work with daily?
* Well, this is one of them.
# This text editor offers a small variety of languages to pick from (resulting in syntax highlighting for different keywords), fully functional syntax highlighting, session saving (if a previous session ws present), two different themes to choose from (white or black, also resulting in different syntax highlighting) and basic tools you can use, like finding a piece of text in a file or zooming in and out for whatever fits your eyes the best.
* While it may not seem much, it basically has what you physically need! It's a low-resource text editor that doesn't have features on every corner of your eyes. Nice on your eyes!
- Have fun!
