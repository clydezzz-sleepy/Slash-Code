# The Slash Code Text Editor

* Hey, there! Have you ever wanted to check out smaller programs that aren't Visual Studio Code or Vim?
* Well, this is one of them.
* This text editor offers a small variety of languages to pick from (resulting in syntax highlighting for different keywords), fully functional syntax highlighting, two different themes to choose from (white or black, also resulting in different syntax highlighting) and basic tools you can use.
* While it may not seem much, it basically has what you physically need! It's a low-resource text editor that doesn't have features on every corner of your eyes. Nice on your eyes!
- Have fun!
